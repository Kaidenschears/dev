        <!-- <h2>My Awesome Content</h2> -->
        <p> Hi there! My name is Kaiden Schears, and I am a senior at UW-Madison set to graduate in May.
             I am deeply passionate about using my software development and data science skills to create something awesome with code. 
             When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors, engaging in activities such as sailing, skiing, and hiking. 
             My hobbies give me more energy and passion for my work by igniting my creativity and curiosity. 
             I am eager to collaborate with others and face new challenges, so please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to work together. 
             Let's connect and see what amazing things we can create together!
