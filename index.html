        <p>Hi, I’m Kaiden Schears. I like building things, breaking them (gently), and figuring out why they work in the first place. I spend my time experimenting with cloud tech, APIs, and AI. Usually, I’m chasing ideas that start as “this might be funny” or “this probably shouldn’t work” and end up surprisingly useful. I’m drawn to lesser-known projects with personality and tools that make people pause for a second before smiling. I care about learning fast, staying curious, and turning half-baked ideas into real things. Long-term, I’m trying to become the kind of technologist who builds with intention, stays human in a world of automation, and enjoys the process along the way. If you want to build something cool or just want to chat about tech and ideas, feel free to reach out! </p>
